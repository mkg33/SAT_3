    // START CONFLICT RESOLUTION

    // Once a conflict occurs, the conflict resolution process starts. A conflict occurs
    // when unit propagation forces the propagation of a literal l, even though literal
    // -l is already asserted. When such a conflict occurs, we need to find the variable
    // assignments that are incompatible and lead to the conflict. Let's say literal 1
    // and literal 3 are incompatible and lead to a conflict. Then the clause [-1, -3]
    // represents this incompatability and we can add this clause to our formula to prevent
    // the same conflict to happen repeatedly. To find this clause, we can imagine a
    // directed graph. Each node of the graph is an asserted literal and an edge from
    // node a to node b means that node a was a reason for the propagation of node b. Let's
    // say we have the clause [1, 2, 3] and -1 and -2 is asserted. Then the graph
    // contains the nodes -1, -2 and 3 with an edge from -1 to 3 and an edge from -2
    // to 3 due to -1 and -2 forcing the propagation of 3. When we detect a conflict,
    // meaning there are literals l and -l as nodes in the graph, we split the graph
    // into a reason side and a conflict side. The conflict side contains literals l
    // and -l. We add all nodes to the conflict side, that we reach before we get
    // to the first occurance of a UIP (first UIP) while going backwards to the node of the current
    // decision literal. A UIP (unique implication point) is any node of the current decision
    // level such that any path from the current decision literal to the conflict node
    // must pass through it. Then the conflict clause consists of all nodes, belonging
    // to the reason side, that have an edge into the conflict side.
